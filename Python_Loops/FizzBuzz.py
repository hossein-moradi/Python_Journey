# Welcome to FizzBuzz game
# These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:
# We will review the numbers between, 1 to 100 and
# If the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# If the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"


for i in range(1,101):
    if i % 3 == 0:

    elif i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    else:
        print(i)
